            <h4>Prisons in New York State</h4>

            <h1>Studio Premise:</h1>

            <p>With a 56% reduction in prison population since 2000, 26 prisons in New York State have closed and more are set to be closed. Layering these closures with policies, economic and community impact, pushback, political positions, criminal justice system and environmental concerns, the studio seeks to envision post-prison futures in the rural towns of upstate New York. We explore the flows and transfers through the prison economy that interconnect these towns and New York City. The projects present a range of visions, focusing on prisons, towns or the system of mass incarceration, and consider state infrastructures- carceral, water, food, power, waste- as urban exostructures.</p>

                <h1>Prison's organization and functioning:</h1>

                <p>New York State has state and federal prisons, but no private prisons. Their administration and regulation relies on the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS), while local governments are in charge of particular policies and programs in each prison.</p>
                <p>Prison staff and guards don’t always come from the areas where prisons are located. They are institutional workers who are assigned positions within the system as required.</p>
                <p>All prisoners have to participate in the labor program, which varies from prison to prison. Prisons also offer internal programs for education, vocational training, assistance for physical and mental health, and drug abuse.</p>
