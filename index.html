            <h4>Prisons in New York State</h4>

            <p>With a 33% reduction in prison population since 2000 (Vera Institute of Justice), a significant number of New York State prisons have closed in recent years and more are set to be closed (26 prisons in total). Layering these closures with associated policies, economic impacts, community impact/ pushback, political positions, criminal justice system and environmental concerns, the studio seeks to envision post-prison futures. The projects are largely situated in upstate New York, in rural towns and villages, and explore the various flows and transfers through the prison economy that connect these towns to each other and to New York City. The projects present a range of visions, focusing on the prison, the town or the system of mass incarceration, and work with the idea of systemically considering state infrastructures- carceral, water, food, power, waste- as urban exostructures.</p>

                <h1>Prison's organization and functioning:</h1>

                <p>New York State has state and federal prisons, but no private prisons. Their administration and regulation relies on the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS), while local governments are in charge of particular policies and programs in each prison.</p>
                <p>Prison staff and guards don’t always come from the areas where prisons are located. They are institutional workers who are assigned positions within the system as required.</p>
                <p>All prisoners have to participate in the labor program, which varies from prison to prison. Prisons also offer internal programs for education, vocational training, assistance for physical and mental health, and drug abuse.</p>
